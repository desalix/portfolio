            Hi! I'm a college student working on a double degree in Computer Science and Business Administration. 
            I enjoy coding in Java (especially OOP) and recently got into frontend developmentâ€”actually built a website for a restaurant with Astro! 
            I'm curious and always looking to learn new tools and frameworks. People would describe me as responsible, polite, and open-minded. 
            Also, I'm bilingual in Spanish and English, which helps me connect with more people and projects.
        </p>
